# Group Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is a collaborative project developed by a team of four students as part of a Git and GitHub learning activity. The objective is to practice using Git branches, pull requests, code reviews, and collaboration workflows on GitHub.

Each team member had a specific role:
- **Repo Owner**: Created the repository and managed collaborators.
- **Feature Developer 1**: Worked on Feature A (`about.md`).
- **Feature Developer 2**: Worked on Feature B (`contact.md`).
- **Reviewer/Merger**: Reviewed code, managed pull requests, and prepared the `README.md`.

The project includes:
- Separate feature branches for different tasks
- Pull requests for code review
- A finalized `main` branch with all features merged
